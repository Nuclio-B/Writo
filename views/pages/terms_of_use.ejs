            By registering as a user of Writo, you accept the following terms
            of use.
          </p>

            Subject matter
          </h2>
          <p class="leading-relaxed">
            These terms of use define the conditions under which Writo may be
            used. Writo is a web-based journaling application that allows the
            user to create a user account and write journal entries. In case
            of non-compliance with the terms of use or misuse of the
            application, Writo reserves the right to block the user and, if
            necessary, delete his/her account. Writo reserves the right to
            make adjustments to the terms of use at any time. Writo will
            inform the user about the new version of the terms of use. By
            continuing to use his/her account, the user agrees to the new
            terms of use.

            User account
          </h2>
          <p class="leading-relaxed">
            In order to be able to use Writo, the user requires access data
            (an email address, an optional login alias and a password). The
            user must notify Writo immediately if there are any signs of
            misuse of his user account by third parties. Writo will never ask
            for the user’s password. The user declares that s/he shall be
            responsible for consequences resulting from any kind of misuse or
            damage if he, intentionally or unintentionally, knowingly or
            unknowingly, enables third parties to use his user account by
            means of his password. Users shall generally be held liable for
            all activities performed under their user account. User content
            submitted to Writo is encrypted with a special security mechanism
            and access is only possible with the user password. In case of
            loss of the password, Writo cannot restore the encrypted content
            of the user. The user shall bear the sole responsibility for the
            password. Writo assumes no responsibility or liability whatsoever
            for any data loss resulting from the loss of a password. For more
            information on the security mechanisms of Writo, go to Security.

            Hacking
          </h2>
          <p class="leading-relaxed">
            Users shall not take any actions which may impose an unreasonable
            or disproportionately large load on the infrastructure of Writo,
            or overwrite, block or modify contents generated by Writo, or
            interfere with the Writo application in any other way.
            Furthermore, electronic attacks of any kind on Writo such as
            hacking, viruses or Trojans are strictly forbidden.

            Availability of the application
          </h2>
          <p class="leading-relaxed">
            Uninterrupted use or availability of Writo cannot be guaranteed.
            In particular, maintenance work, security or capacity issues
            beyond the control of Writo can cause temporary non-availability
            of the services. Writo shall, however, make every effort to ensure
            constant availability of the application to the extent possible.
            To be able to make full use of the services offered by Writo, the
            user must use up-to-date (browser) technologies. If older or not
            commonly used technologies are used, the user might only be able
            to make limited use of the services provided by Writo. Please
            refer to the FAQs for browser-specific limitations.

            Costs
          </h2>
          <p class="leading-relaxed">
            The use of the Writo application is currently free of charge.
            Writo reserves the right, however, to introduce additional paid
            services in the future. Limitation on liability Writo is not
            liable for any data loss or damage that results from the use of
            this application. Likewise, no liability is assumed for damages
            resulting from unauthorised access. Writo further assumes no
            liability for user-generated content or the actual identity of a
            user. Writo will be liable for damages caused by wilful intent or
            gross negligence.

            Protection of data privacy

            Data security
          </h2>
          <p class="leading-relaxed">
            Despite regular data backups, Writo cannot rule out the
            possibility of data loss – in particular due to force majeure or
            unlawful activities of third parties. Writo will therefore not be
            liable for any loss of data.

            Cancellation and deletion of the user account
          </h2>
          <p class="leading-relaxed">
            Should a user no longer wish to use Writo, he may terminate the
            user agreement any time without cause by de-registering under
            “Settings”. Alternatively, the user may cancel the account by
            sending an email to info@writo.in . Writo reserves the right to
            delete a user’s account with prior notice if it hasn’t been used
            for 12 consecutive months.

            Final provisions
          </h2>
          <p class="leading-relaxed">
            If an individual provision of this agreement is or becomes
            completely or partially invalid, the validity of the other
            provisions shall remain unaffected. Place of jurisdiction is the
            domicile of the provider
